# Canvosys

Canvosys is a program for simulating what election results could have been under different voting systems based on data from existing elections. This tool was created with a focus on Canadian elections, and at first will only work for Canadian elections, but may in the future be expanded to include ability to work with data from other countries in various formats.

## Supported Voting Systems
- None so far! Planned support is at the beginning just First Past the Post (For sanity checks against actual elections) and single winner Instant Runoff Voting, which is a commonly proposed alternative for Canada.
